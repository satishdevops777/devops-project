# RoboShop – Redis Service Setup

## 📌 What is Redis in RoboShop?

**Redis** is used as an **in-memory data store (cache)** in RoboShop.

It helps by:

* Reducing database load
* Improving application response time
* Storing frequently accessed data in memory

In RoboShop, backend services (like **User**, **Cart**, etc.) access Redis over the network.

## 🧱 Technology Overview

| Component       | Details                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Database Type   | In-memory (Key–Value Store) |
| Redis Version   | 6.x (6.2 compatible)        |
| OS              | RHEL / CentOS / Rocky Linux |
| Service Manager | systemd                     |

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Redis version must be chosen based on **developer guidance**
* Default Redis configuration allows access **only from localhost**
* RoboShop requires Redis to be accessible **from other servers**

---

## 1️⃣ Install Redis (Using DNF Modules)

### Why DNF Modules?

RHEL-based systems support **multiple Redis versions** using module streams. We explicitly enable Redis **6.x** to match application compatibility.

---

### Disable default Redis module

```bash
dnf module disable redis -y
```

This avoids installing an older or unsupported version.

---

### Enable Redis 6.x module

```bash
dnf module enable redis:6 -y
```

This ensures Redis 6.x (6.2 compatible) is installed.

---

### Install Redis

```bash
dnf install redis -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash
redis-server --version
```

---

## 2️⃣ Why Redis Is Not Accessible by Default

By default, Redis listens only on:

```text
127.0.0.1 (localhost)
```

### What this means

* Only applications running **on the same server** can connect
* Remote application servers **cannot access Redis**

This is a **secure default**, but not suitable for RoboShop.

---

## 3️⃣ Update Redis Listen Address

### Why change to `0.0.0.0`?

`0.0.0.0` means:

> “Accept connections from **any network interface**”

This allows other RoboShop services to connect to Redis.

---

### Files to update

Redis configuration may exist in **two locations** (depends on OS/package):

* `/etc/redis.conf`
* `/etc/redis/redis.conf`

---

### Edit configuration files

```bash
vim /etc/redis.conf
vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

### Change this line

```ini
bind 127.0.0.1
```

### To

```ini
bind 0.0.0.0
```

> ⚠️ Ensure both config files are updated if they exist.

---

## 🔐 Security Note (Very Important)

Exposing Redis publicly **without protection is dangerous**.

In real production environments, Redis should be:

* Accessible only inside a **private network (VPC)**
* Protected by **firewall / security groups**
* Optionally secured using **authentication (`requirepass`)**

RoboShop labs keep it simple for learning purposes.

---

## 4️⃣ Start and Enable Redis Service

### Enable Redis at boot

```bash
systemctl enable redis
```

### Start Redis service

```bash
systemctl start redis
```

### Check service status

```bash
systemctl status redis
```

Expected result:

* Service should be **active (running)**

---

## 5️⃣ Validate Redis Connectivity

### Local test

```bash
redis-cli ping
```

Expected output:

```text
PONG
```

---

### Remote connectivity test (from another server)

```bash
redis-cli -h <REDIS-SERVER-IP> ping
```

Expected output:

```text
PONG
```

This confirms Redis is accessible over the network.

## 🔁 How Redis Fits in RoboShop Architecture

```text
Backend Service (User / Cart)
 → Redis (In-memory cache)
 → Faster response
 → Reduced database load
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue                | Cause                    | Fix                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Connection refused   | Redis bound to localhost | Set bind to 0.0.0.0 |
| Port blocked         | Firewall rules           | Open port 6379      |
| Service not starting | Config syntax error      | Check redis.conf    |
| App not using Redis  | Wrong Redis IP           | Update app config   |

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

* [x] Redis 6.x installed
* [x] Redis module enabled correctly
* [x] Bind address updated to 0.0.0.0
* [x] Redis service running
* [x] Redis accessible remotely
