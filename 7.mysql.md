# RoboShop – MySQL Database Setup

This document explains how to install and configure **MySQL 5.7** for the RoboShop application. It is written in **GitHub-ready README.md format**, aligned with **real-world DevOps / SRE practices**.

---

## 📌 Why MySQL in RoboShop?

MySQL is used as a **relational database** in RoboShop to store **transactional and structured data** (for example, Shipping and Orders-related information).

The developer has explicitly chosen **MySQL 5.7**, so the infrastructure must match this requirement.

## 🧱 Technology Stack

| Component        | Details                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Database         | MySQL Community Server          |
| Required Version | 5.7                             |
| OS               | CentOS 8 / RHEL 8 / Rocky Linux |
| Service Manager  | systemd                         |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Application compatibility decides DB version**
* CentOS 8 installs **MySQL 8** by default (NOT compatible here)
* We must explicitly install **MySQL 5.7**

---

## 1️⃣ Disable Default MySQL Module (MySQL 8)

### Why?

CentOS 8 enables MySQL 8 by default using AppStream modules. Installing MySQL 8 will break application compatibility.

Disable it:

```bash
dnf module disable mysql -y
```

---

## 2️⃣ Configure MySQL 5.7 Repository

### Why a custom repo?

MySQL 5.7 is **not available** in CentOS 8 default repositories.

We use the **official MySQL Community repository**.

---

### Create repo file

```bash
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo
```

### Repository configuration

```ini
[mysql]
name=MySQL 5.7 Community Server
baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

> ℹ️ This repository works across compatible RHEL-based systems.

---

## 3️⃣ Install MySQL 5.7 Server

```bash
dnf install mysql-community-server -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash
mysqld --version
```

Expected output:

```text
mysqld  Ver 5.7.x
```

---

## 4️⃣ Start and Enable MySQL Service

### Enable MySQL at boot

```bash
systemctl enable mysqld
```

### Start MySQL service

```bash
systemctl start mysqld
```

### Verify service status

```bash
systemctl status mysqld
```

Expected state:

```text
active (running)
```

---

## 5️⃣ Secure MySQL Installation

### Why secure installation?

By default:

* MySQL root account has a temporary or random password
* Weak security defaults are enabled

We must set a **known strong root password**.

---

### Set root password

```bash
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass RoboShop@1
```

> You may choose a different strong password as per your policy.

---

## 6️⃣ Validate MySQL Access

### Login using new password

```bash
mysql -uroot -pRoboShop@1
```

Expected result:

```text
Welcome to the MySQL monitor
```

This confirms:

* MySQL is running
* Root password is updated successfully

---

## 🔐 Security Notes (Production Perspective)

In real production environments:

* Root login is restricted
* Application uses a **separate DB user**
* Firewall limits access to MySQL port **3306**

RoboShop labs keep it simple for learning.

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue                | Cause             | Fix                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Wrong MySQL version  | MySQL 8 installed | Disable mysql module       |
| Service not starting | Repo issue        | Verify repo URL            |
| Login fails          | Wrong password    | Re-run secure installation |
| Connection refused   | Firewall blocking | Open port 3306             |

## 🔁 How MySQL Fits in RoboShop Architecture

```text
Shipping / Orders Service
 → MySQL 5.7 Database
 → Persistent transactional data
```
